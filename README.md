# Beauty-Parlouer-Services-1

Beauty Parlour Services is a dynamic web application developed using the Laravel framework as part of my final year academic project in Information Technology. This project is designed to simplify and digitalize the process of booking beauty parlour services for customers while providing an efficient management system for beauty parlour owners.

Due to an unexpected laptop reset, I had to recreate the entire project from scratch. I carefully rebuilt it step by step as per the required specifications and implemented all the necessary features again to ensure the project meets the academic standards and functions smoothly.
